# PHP Docker Controller

This is the code for the PHP Docker controller.

## How to run

Running this locally requires Docker Engine on the same machine. 
If this is the case, just execute the following command:

```
composer install --no-dev
cd public/
php -S 0.0.0.0:8080
```

You can then access the web interface at `localhost:8080`.
