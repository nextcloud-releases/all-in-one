# AWS

The AWS build is mostly based on the guide from here: https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/packer/aws-get-started

You can go here: https://github.com/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one/actions/workflows/publish-to-aws.yml to create a new image.

The image can then be reached in for testing here: https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/manage-products/#/

Afterwards the image can be updated here: https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/products/server
