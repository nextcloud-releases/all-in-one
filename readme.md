# Nextcloud All In One Beta
This is beta software and not production ready.
But feel free to use it at your own risk!
We expect there to be rough edges and potentially serious bugs.

Nextcloud AIO stands for Nextcloud All In One and provides easy deployment and maintenance with most features included in this one Nextcloud instance. 

Included are:
- Nextcloud
- Nextcloud Office
- High performance backend for Nextcloud Files
- High performance backend for Nextcloud Talk
- Backup solution (based on [BorgBackup](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg#what-is-borgbackup))

## How to use this?
1. Install Docker on your Linux installations using:

```
curl -fsSL get.docker.com | sudo sh
```
2. Make sure to pull the latest image:

```
sudo docker pull nextcloud/all-in-one:latest
```
3. Run the following command in order to start the container:

```
sudo docker run -it \
--name nextcloud-aio-mastercontainer \
--restart always \
-p 80:80 \
-p 8080:8080 \
-p 8443:8443 \
--volume nextcloud_aio_mastercontainer:/mnt/docker-aio-config \
--volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
nextcloud/all-in-one:latest
```
4. After the initial startup, you should be able to open the Nextcloud AIO Interface now on port 8080 of this server.<br>
E.g. https://internal.ip.of.this.server:8080<br>
If your server has port 80 and 8443 open and you point a domain to your server, you can get a valid certificate automatially by opening the Nextcloud AIO Interface via:<br>
https://your-domain-that-points-to-this-server.tld:8443

## FAQ
### How does it work?
Nextcloud AIO is inspired by projects like Portainer that allow to manage the docker daemon by talking to the docker socket directly. This concept allows to install only one container with a single command that does the heavy lifting of creating and managing all containers that are needed in order to provide a Nextcloud installation with most features included. It also makes updating a breeze and is not bound to the host system (and its slow updates) anymore as everything is in containers. Additionally, it is very easy to handle from a user perspective because a simple interface for managing your Nextcloud AIO installation is provided.

### Are reverse proxies supported?
Reverse proxies are currently because of the above mentioned architecture not supported.<br>
You might investigate yourself though how it could made work behind reverse proxies. If you open a PR with that we might consider it then :)

### Which ports are mandatory to be open?
Only those (if you acces the Mastercontainer Interface internally via port 8080):
- `443/TCP` for the Nextcloud container
- `3478/TCP` and `3478/UPD` for the Talk container

### Explanation of used ports:
- `8080/TCP`: Mastercontainer Interface with self-signed certificate (works always, also if only access via IP-address is possible, e.g. `https://internal.ip.address:8080/`)
- `80/TCP`: redirects to Nextcloud (is used for getting the certificate via ACME http-challenge for the Mastercontainer)
- `8443/TCP`: Mastercontainer Interface with valid certificate (only works if port 80 and 8443 are open and you point a domain to your server. It generates a valid certificate then automatically and access via e.g. `https://public.domain.com:8443/` is possible.)
- `443/TCP`: will be used by the Nextcloud container later on and needs to be open
- `3478/TCP` and `3478/UPD`: will be used by the Turnserver inside the Talk container and needs to be open

### How to run `occ` commands?
Simply run the following: `sudo docker exec -it nextcloud-aio-nextcloud php occ your-command`. Of course `your-command` needs to be exchanged with the command that you want to run.

### How to resolve `Security & setup warnings displays the "missing default phone region" after initial install`?
Simply run the following command: `sudo docker exec -it nextcloud-aio-nextcloud php occ config:system:set default_phone_region --value="yourvalue"`. Of course you need to modify `yourvalue` based on your location. Examples are `DE`, `EN` and `GB`. See this list for more codes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements

### How to update the containers?
If we push new containers to `latest`, you will see in the AIO interface below the `containers` section that new container updates were found. In this case, just press `Stop containers` and `Start containers` in order to update the containers. The mastercontainer has its own update procedure though. See below. And don't forget to back up the current state of your instance using the built-in backup solution before starting the containers again! Otherwise you won't be able to restore your instance easily if something should break during the update. 

If a new `Mastercontainer` update was found, you'll see an additional section below the `containers` section which shows that a mastercontainer update is available. If so, you can simply press on the button to update the container.

Additionally, there is a cronjob that runs once a day that checks for container and mastercontainer updates and sends a notification to all Nextcloud admins if a new update was found.

### How to easily log in to the AIO interface?
If your Nextcloud is running and you are logged in as admin in your Nextcloud, you can easily log in to the AIO interface by opening `https://yourdomain.tld/settings/admin/overview` which will show a button on top that enables you to log in to the AIO interface by just clicking on this button. 

### Backup solution
Nextcloud AIO provides a local backup solution based on BorgBackup. These backups act as a local restore point in case the installation gets corrupted. 

It is recommended to create a backup before any container update. By doing this, you will be safe regarding any possible complication during updates because you will be able to restore the whole instance with basically one click. 

If you connect an external drive to your host, and choose the backup directory to be on that drive, you are also kind of save against drive failures of the drive where the docker volumes are stored on. 

Backups can be created and restored in the AIO interface using the buttons `Create Backup` and `Restore last backup`. Additionally, a backup check is provided that checks the integrity of your backups but it shouldn't be needed in most situations. 

The backups itself get encrypted with an encryption key that gets shown to you in the AIO interface. Please save that at a safe place as you will not be able to restore from backup without this key.

Note that this implementation does not provide remote backups, for this you can use the [backup app](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/backup). 

### Access/Edit Nextcloud files/folders manually
The files and folders that you add to Nextcloud are by default stored in the following directory: `/var/lib/docker/volumes/nextcloud_aio_nextcloud_data/_data/` on the host. If needed, you can modify/add/delete files/folders there but **ATTENTION**: be very careful when doing so because you might corrupt your AIO installation! Best is to create a backup using the built-in backup solution before editing/changing files/folders in there because you will then be able to restore your instance to the backed up state.

After you are done modifying/adding/deleting files/folders, don't forget to apply the correct permissions by running: `sudo chown -R 33:0 /var/lib/docker/volumes/nextcloud_aio_nextcloud_data/_data/*` and rescan the files with `sudo docker exec -it nextcloud-aio-nextcloud php occ files:scan --all`.

### How to store the files/installation on a separate drive?
You can move the whole docker library and all its files including all Nextcloud AIO files and folders to a separate drive by first mounting the drive in the host OS (NTFS is not supported) and then following this tutorial: https://www.guguweb.com/2019/02/07/how-to-move-docker-data-directory-to-another-location-on-ubuntu/<br>
(Of course docker needs to be installed first for this to work.)

### How to edit Nextclouds config.php file with a texteditor?
You can edit Nextclouds config.php file directly from the host with your favorite text editor. E.g. like this: `sudo nano /var/lib/docker/volumes/nextcloud_aio_nextcloud/_data/config/config.php`. Make sure to not break the file though which might corrupt your Nextcloud instance otherwise. In best case, create a backup using the built-in backup solution before editing the file.

### How to migrate from an already existing Nextcloud installation to Nextcloud AIO?
Please see the following documentation on this: [migration.md](https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/blob/main/migration.md)
